Apache Oozie is a scheduler system to run and manage Hadoop jobs in a distributed environment. It allows to combine multiple complex jobs to be run in a sequential order to achieve a bigger task. Within a sequence of task, two or more jobs can also be programmed to run parallel to each other.\

Following three types of jobs are common in Oozie


    Oozie Workflow Jobs − These are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to specify a sequence of actions to be executed.

    Oozie Coordinator Jobs − These consist of workflow jobs triggered by time and data availability.

    Oozie Bundle − These can be referred to as a package of multiple coordinator and workflow jobs.


Workflow nodes are classified in control flow nodes and action nodes:

    Control flow nodes: nodes that control the start and end of the workflow and workflow job execution path.
    Action nodes: nodes that trigger the execution of a computation/processing task.



Coordinator:
<coordinator-app xmlns = "uri:oozie:coordinator:0.2" name =
   "coord_copydata_from_external_orc" frequency = "5 * * * *" start =
   "2016-00-18T01:00Z" end = "2025-12-31T00:00Z"" timezone = "America/Los_Angeles">
